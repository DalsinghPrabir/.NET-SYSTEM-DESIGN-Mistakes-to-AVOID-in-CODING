SYSTEM DESIGN MISTAKES  TO AVOID
5 System Design Mistakes to Avoid in .NET Projects (and How to Fix Them) 🚩
Over the years working with the .NET ecosystem, I’ve noticed some recurring system design pitfalls that can slow down development or cripple scalability. Here are five common mistakes — and practical ways to avoid them:

1️⃣ Tight Coupling Between Components
When services or modules depend too heavily on each other, changes become risky and slow.
Fix: Embrace interfaces, Dependency Injection, and design patterns to decouple your codebase and make testing easier.

2️⃣ Ignoring Asynchronous and Event-Driven Patterns
Synchronous, blocking calls can bottleneck your system under load.
Fix: Use Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, or Event Grid for async messaging and build reactive, scalable microservices.

3️⃣ Neglecting Real-Time Communication Needs
Real-time updates often get treated as afterthoughts.
Fix: Integrate SignalR or gRPC early to enable fast, efficient inter-service and client communication.

4️⃣ One-Size-Fits-All Data Storage
Using a single database type for all data needs leads to performance and scalability issues.
Fix: Mix SQL Server, Cosmos DB, Redis Cache, and Blob Storage strategically depending on your use case.

5️⃣ Security as an Afterthought
Skipping security early causes costly refactors and vulnerabilities.
Fix: Build security in from day one — leverage Azure AD, OAuth 2.0, and IdentityServer for authentication and authorization.

System design is as much about avoiding mistakes as it is about making the right architectural choices. Avoid these traps, and your .NET applications will be more resilient, maintainable, and ready to scale.





Here’s how a typical system design interview happens (from a real conversation)

1. Handling Millions of Requests per Second 

Interviewer: “Your system needs to handle millions of requests per second. What’s your approach?” 

You: I’ll start with a load balancer to evenly distribute traffic across multiple application servers and I will also use a Reverse Proxy like NGINX or AWS ALB for added routing intelligence. 


2. Server Failures and High Availability 

Interviewer: “What happens if a server goes down?” 

You: I’d replicate data across multiple servers and set up a heartbeat mechanism to detect failures. Failed servers are replaced using auto-scaling in cloud services. 


3. Scaling for Traffic Spikes 

Interviewer: “What if traffic spikes overnight?” 

You: Horizontal scaling, I’d add more servers dynamically behind the load balancer using auto-scaling groups or Kubernetes clusters. 

I will also use caching layers like Redis or Memcached to reduce backend load. 

4. Storing Large Volumes of Data 

Interviewer: “How would you store terabytes or petabytes of data?” 

You: I’d shard the database and distribute data across multiple nodes using techniques like consistent hashing to avoid data imbalance. 

5. Ensuring Data Durability 

Interviewer: “How do you ensure no data is lost?” 

You: Replication, I’d keep multiple copies of data using a Primary-Replica setup or a Leaderless Replication model.  For mission-critical systems, multi-region replication ensures disaster recovery. 


6. Dealing with Write Performance Issues 

Interviewer: “Won’t replication slow down writes?” 

You: It depends on whether we prioritize strong consistency or eventual consistency. 
- For strong consistency, wait until writes propagate to all replicas before returning success. 
- For high write throughput, go with eventual consistency like DynamoDB or Cassandra. 

7. Conflict Resolution in Distributed Systems 

Interviewer: “How do you handle conflicting writes in distributed databases?” 

You: Use techniques like vector clocks or timestamps to track versions of data. Conflicts can be resolved during reads using application logic. 

8. Write-Heavy Use Cases
Interviewer: “When would you use leaderless replication?” 

You: Leaderless systems like Cassandra are great for high-write use cases, where speed matters more than consistency—e.g., logging systems or IoT data collection.

SYSTEM DESIGN MISTAKES  TO AVOID
5 System Design Mistakes to Avoid in .NET Projects (and How to Fix Them) üö©
Over the years working with the .NET ecosystem, I‚Äôve noticed some recurring system design pitfalls that can slow down development or cripple scalability. Here are five common mistakes ‚Äî and practical ways to avoid them:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Tight Coupling Between Components
When services or modules depend too heavily on each other, changes become risky and slow.
Fix: Embrace interfaces, Dependency Injection, and design patterns to decouple your codebase and make testing easier.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ignoring Asynchronous and Event-Driven Patterns
Synchronous, blocking calls can bottleneck your system under load.
Fix: Use Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, or Event Grid for async messaging and build reactive, scalable microservices.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Neglecting Real-Time Communication Needs
Real-time updates often get treated as afterthoughts.
Fix: Integrate SignalR or gRPC early to enable fast, efficient inter-service and client communication.

4Ô∏è‚É£ One-Size-Fits-All Data Storage
Using a single database type for all data needs leads to performance and scalability issues.
Fix: Mix SQL Server, Cosmos DB, Redis Cache, and Blob Storage strategically depending on your use case.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Security as an Afterthought
Skipping security early causes costly refactors and vulnerabilities.
Fix: Build security in from day one ‚Äî leverage Azure AD, OAuth 2.0, and IdentityServer for authentication and authorization.

System design is as much about avoiding mistakes as it is about making the right architectural choices. Avoid these traps, and your .NET applications will be more resilient, maintainable, and ready to scale.
